# ProCrastinator
BrainStation capstone

**``Procrastinator is a self-help website to help people prioritize their daily work and improve their efficiency.``** 

This is a project I developed for my capstone project at Brainstation.

**``Tech Stack``**
-	HTML, SCSS, React.js, Material UI, Firebase/Firestore.

**``Here is the vision which gave me the drive to create this app``**

Generally, we tend to organize our work but falls short now and then which frustrates us and we do not get the feeling of achievement and happiness. 
Though we may have done other important things efficiently, not completing the prioritized work on time leads us to feel guilty and annoyed. 
This app/website is designed specifically to target those pain points and keep track of our achievement and move ahead. 

This app/website can be used by anyone who wants to achieve success in life, career, relationships, etc. 
This will have a simple interface which will help users to adapt easily and would not feature anything heavy which would confuse users rather than helping them with simplicity.
